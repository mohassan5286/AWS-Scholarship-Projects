# AWS Scholarship Projects

## 1. AWS Scholarship 1 - Project 2
In this project, users input parameters through the command line interface and argparse. These parameters include the data directory, checkpoint storage directory, model name, learning rate, the count of hidden units in the layers, the number of epochs, and the choice of utilizing GPU. Detailed information is displayed at each epoch, encompassing the current epoch number, accuracy, and running loss. Furthermore, users can evaluate checkpoints, obtaining the name of the identified item along with associated probabilities, providing a measure of certainty for each result.

### Dependencies for Machine Learning Application:
Establishing a virtual environment necessitates the incorporation of essential packages such as torch, JSON, numpy, PIL, and matplotlib. This ensures a well-configured environment tailored to the requirements of the project.
